# Increase-Num-of-Images-in-the-Database-to-Improve-Efficiency-for-your-ML-Based-Projects.
Duplicating parts of the images in the database to increase the number of images is a common technique to increase accuracy of your ML project (instead of adding new images to the database). The code to implement the same is provided here.


#### Remember this is not a recommendable way to improve accuracy of your project. It is always advisable to add new images to the directory for better performance. But, in certain situations we find fewer images in the dataset. In such situations, use this to create n number of images in your database from your limited images.

Say there are 20 images in your folder and you cant find any new, use this code to create 2000 images from those 20.
